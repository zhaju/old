As mentioned, I’ve done competitive math for more than 10 years, and written countless contests (including the AMCs, AIME, COMC, and CEMC series). I’ve gained a lot of experience and taught many people, whether that be through [schoolhouse.world](https://schoolhouse.world/), my school’s Math Society, or independent tutoring. Here are some of the handouts and resources I’ve compiled to help grade 7-12 students in learning both curriculum and contest math.

#Quadratics (for Grade 9)
A 5-part handout made for schoolhouse.world on quadratics.

#Logarithms (for Grade 11-12)
A 5-part handout made for schoolhouse.world on logarithms

#Contests
An 8-part handout which serves as an introduction to Grade 9-10 contests, including the AMCs and COMC, made for the UTS Math Society.

A 16-page compendium which can be used as a study doc or crash course for all high school-level math contest.
